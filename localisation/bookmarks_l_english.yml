 ENG_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "World War Two was a costly battle for the United Kingdom. It showed the empire was not what it used to be, and thought the dark times are over, many are beginning to question if signing a peace deal with Germany was such a good idea. Winston Churchill was voted out as most thought the Labour Party would be best for rebuilding the country. Rommel may have wanted peace then, but can the empire be so sure that he isn't rebuilding the Reichs army to wage a Third World War?"
 FRA_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "France was devesated by the Nazis, and many suffered under their rule. The nation will never be the same after the war, and many are upset that Germany was let off so easily despite what they did to France. They had distanced themselves from the Brtish after they were forced to sign a peace deal by them. The French may have their nation back, but at what cost?"
 GER_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "The Reich had split into two after the war ended, with the Waffen SS seizing southern Germany. Rommel may have the Wermacht's support but how long will it last? Some extremist in the high command believe Germany should rebuild the army, then start another war, but Rommel fears that the atomic weapons that were used on Japan may be used on Germany if he does this."
 ITA_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "Japan did not participate in the peace deal betweem Germany, the Allies, and the Soviet Union, instead they continued fighting, seeing surrender as the most shameful thing the country could do. This however would secure near total annihilation of the country. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were razed to the ground by Little Boy and Fat Man."
 SOV_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
